# Comparison of numerical methods through the shock-tube problem

### How to run
To generate the solutions, run 'riemann_solve.py'.

To then visualize the solutions, run the jupiter notebook 'plot_results.ipynb'.

### Notes
The code is commented with the chapters and equation numbers from the book "Toro, E.F. (2009) Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics a practical introduction by Eleuterio F. Toro. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg" cited also in the report. The same concepts are also included in the report, but referring directly to the book allows to connect them with the greater theory explained in the book.
