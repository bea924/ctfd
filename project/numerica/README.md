# Comparison of different Riemann problem solutions

### Description

### How to run
To generate the solutions needed for the plots, run 'riemann_solve.py'. It might take some time to run since its generating a lot of data. To then visualize the solutions, one can run the jupiter notebook 'plot_results.ipynb'.
